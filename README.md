# MailExtract

MailExtract is a small ruby library to parse plain-text email contents.

It removes all quoted text and signatures leaving only original text. 

## Installation

    gem install mail_extract

## Usage

### General usage

```ruby
require 'mail_extract'

body = MailExtract::Parser.new('MESSAGE').body

# or via shortcut
body = MailExtract.new('MESSAGE').body

# or via another shortcut
body = MailExtract.parse('MESSAGE')
```

### Using with Mail gem

```ruby
require 'mail'
require 'mail_extract'

mail = Mail.read_from_string(YOUR_MESSAGE_BODY)

# find only plain-text parts
if mail.multipart?
  part = mail.parts.select { |p| p.content_type =~ /text\/plain/ }.first rescue nil
  unless part.nil?
    message = part.body.decoded
  end
else
  message = mail.body.decoded
end

clean_message = MailExtract.new(message).body
```

### Configuration

If you need to grab only a head part of the message body you need to specify *:only_head* parameter:

```ruby
MailExtract.new(message, :only_head => true)
```

This is extremely useful if you're parsing an email from mobile devices (iphone?) which do not follow the quote pattens.

## Known issues

- Invalid signature patterns (that does not follow --, ___)
- Invalid quote patterns (that does not start with >)
